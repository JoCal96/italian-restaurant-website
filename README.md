<h1>Resturant Website 👩‍🍳</h1>

<p>A completed basic resturant website. Made using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap and Javascript.</p>

<h2>About This website 🍝</h2>

<p>Originally part of the CodeFirstGirls Web Dev Kickstarter course and created as a group of 4. While creating my section (originally the bottom third of the home page consisting of a booking form and footer.) I continued on to create a mock of the whole home page, to get a better feel of how this would look. Once the course was completed I have expanded this web project to practice the HTML and CSS skills learnt. This is my first web development project.

The website now has 3 static pages: Home, Menu and Booking.</p>

<h2>Technologies 💻</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML: Structure of the website</li>
  <li>Bootstrap CSS: Styling and layout</li>
  <li>JavaScript: Booking form pop-up confirmation and menu carousel</li>
</ul>
